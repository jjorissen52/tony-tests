## What's the buzz about?
This is a traditional "easy" programming test, 
just so we know you have some idea what's going on.

---------------------------

Given an integer `n`, return a list (or iterable) where:
- `result[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by both `3` and `5`
- `result[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3`
- `result[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5`
- `result[i] == i` otherwise
